# About Jamming

Jamming allows users to create and save new playlists to their Spotify account.

This application accomplishes the following:

* Searches for Spotify content according to users' input. The user can search music by a song's name, an artist, or an album.
* Displays a list of results. Each result includes a song's name, artist, album, and a play button.
* Plays a 30-second preview of the song by clicking the play button. When playing the preview, a pause button will appear to pause the song on click.
* Displays the new playlist with a title, songs added, and a "/Save to Spotify"/ button.
* Adds and removes songs to the new playlist by clicking the plus or minus button at the right of the song information.
* Modifies the playlist name by writing over the "/new playlist"/ title.
* Saves the new playlist to the user Spotify's account by clicking the Save To Spotify button.

This web application was created as part of the Web Development'course at [`Codeacademy`](https://www.codecademy.com) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting started

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

For the application to work, *you will need a Spotify account*. If you are not log in when using Jamming, the application will open an authentification page requesting you to log in. 

## Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
